Encapsulation is the practice of protecting a class’s internal data and methods by restricting direct access to them. Only approved parts of the program can interact with that data through controlled interfaces. This is important because it prevents accidental changes to internal state as a program grows or evolves.

The benefits of encapsulation include safety, flexibility, and clarity. Outside code cannot unintentionally break the internal logic, developers can modify implementations without invalidating existing behavior, and each class becomes cleaner and easier to understand.

In the example below, _book, _chapter, and _verse are marked private, meaning no external code can modify them directly. The constructor (public Reference) and the public method GetDisplayText() provide controlled access to that internal data.

public class Reference
{
    private string _book;
    private int _chapter;
    private int _verse;

    public Reference(string book, int chapter, int verse)
    {
        _book = book;
        _chapter = chapter;
        _verse = verse;
    }

    public string GetDisplayText()
    {
        return $"{_book} {_chapter}:{_verse}";
    }
}
