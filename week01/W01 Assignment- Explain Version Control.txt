Version control is a system that tracks and saves changes to a file as the user works. This allows the user to review their edits and revert to earlier versions if necessary. An example of version control is Git, which GitHub uses. Version control is important because it provides built‑in backups that show exactly what was changed and when. On a software development team, version control might be used while developing a software program. If the team is using GitHub, each member may be assigned a specific branch to work on. When a team member finishes their work, they can submit their branch and open a pull request so others can review it. If everything checks out, the changes can be merged into the main program. An example of a Git command would be: git commit -m "Reviewed line spacing and adjusted root color scheme to avoid contrast issues".
